# OSF Folder Synchronization Explained

This project includes a Bash script that simplifies the use of the `osfclient` tool for synchronizing local files and those on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

## Steps to Follow:
1. **Make sure, Python is installed, including pip**

1. **Create the Initialization File:**
   Place the file `initializeOSF.command` in any folder of your choice. This folder will later contain a designated upload folder for all files to be uploaded.

3. **Run the Initialization Script:**
   Double-click the `initializeOSF.command` file. A terminal window will open, prompting you to enter your OSF username and project ID. If your comoputer doesn't allow you to open the file, open a Terminal in the folder you placed the file in, execute the following command: `bash initalizeOSF.command`

   **Windows:**
   You need to be inside the folder to right click and then open in Terminal.

   **Mac:**
   You need to be outside the folder, then right click on the folder and open in Terminal.

4. **Enter Your Credentials:**
   - Your username is your email address.
   - The project ID can be found in the URL of your project. For example, in `https://osf.io/wk5sd/`, `wk5sd` is the ID. 
   - Note that it doesnâ€™t matter which email you provide here, as the script will prompt for the username each time to allow multiple users to utilize their own OSF accounts.

5. **File Preparation:**
   After initializing the OSF client, a folder named `hierUploaden` will be created. Place all files you want to appear in your OSF project in this folder.

6. **Upload Process:**
   Simply dropping files into the `hierUploaden` folder will not trigger an upload. The upload occurs only when you run the `updaten.command` file. For technical reasons, each file in the OSF storage will be deleted before re-uploading the files from the `hierUploaden` folder.

7. **Online Storage**
   The uploaded files will be stored in a folder called `Files` in your project.

8. **Password Security:**
   The password you are prompted to enter will not be stored in the file or on the server/folder! Once you close the terminal window, no one can access the previously entered password.
